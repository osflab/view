# OSF view component

Under development

## Features

* Bootstrap / VueJS / JQuery integration (and more)
* Optimized for REST & Ajax calls
* A lot of good helpers
* Based and compatible with Zend View
* A CRUD manager

## Installation

You need at least php 7.1 and `composer`:

```bash
sudo apt install composer
```

### In your application via composer

This is the recommended way to use this feature in a non-osf project.

Just add `osflab/view` in your composer.json file.

### From github

To test the component or participate in its development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osflab/view.git
cd view && composer update
```

Unit tests launch:

```bash
php ./vendor/osflab/test/run-tests.php
```
